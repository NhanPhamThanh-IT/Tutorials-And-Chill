### <a href='https://github.com/NhanPhamThanh-IT/R-Tutorial/tree/main/DataInterfaces'>Chapter 2 - Data Interfaces</a>
This section covers various methods to import and export data in R. You will learn how to work with different file formats, databases, and web data.

- **CSV Files**: How to read from and write to CSV files using R's built-in functions.
- **Excel Files**: Techniques for handling Excel data, including reading from and writing to Excel files with libraries like `readxl` and `writexl`.
- **Binary Files**: Understanding binary data formats and how to read and write binary files in R.
- **XML and JSON Files**: Methods for working with structured data formats, including parsing XML and JSON data using packages like `xml2` and `jsonlite`.
- **Web Data**: Learn how to scrape and import data from the web, using tools such as `rvest` for web scraping and APIs for data retrieval.
- **Database**: Connect to databases and perform data operations using packages like `DBI` and `RMySQL`, allowing you to run queries and manage data directly from R.

### <a href='https://github.com/NhanPhamThanh-IT/R-Tutorial/tree/main/ChartsAndGraphs'>Chapter 3 - Charts and Graphs</a>
In this folder, you will find resources for visualizing data. It includes different types of plots and graphs that can help you present your findings effectively.

- **Pie Charts**: Learn how to create pie charts to display proportions of a whole using the `pie()` function.
- **Bar Charts**: Step-by-step guide to creating bar charts with `barplot()` and the `ggplot2` package for categorical data representation.
- **Boxplots**: Discover how to create boxplots using the `boxplot()` function to visualize the distribution of data and identify outliers.
- **Histograms**: Instructions for creating histograms with the `hist()` function to represent the distribution of continuous data.
- **Line Graphs**: Step-by-step guide to creating line graphs with `plot()` and `ggplot2` for visualizing trends over time.
- **Scatterplots**: Learn how to create scatterplots using `plot()` and `ggplot2` to examine relationships between two numerical variables.

### <a href='https://github.com/NhanPhamThanh-IT/R-Tutorial/tree/main/Statistics'>Chapter 4 - Statistics</a>
This section delves into statistical methods using R. It includes both descriptive and inferential statistics, providing a comprehensive overview of data analysis techniques.
