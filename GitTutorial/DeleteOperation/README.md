Tom updates his local repository and finds the compiled binary in the __src__ directory. After viewing the commit message, he realizes that the compiled binary was added by Jerry.

```bash
[tom@CentOS src]$ pwd
/home/tom/project/src

[tom@CentOS src]$ ls
Makefile string_operations string_operations.c

[tom@CentOS src]$ file string_operations
string_operations: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses
shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, not stripped

[tom@CentOS src]$ git log
commit 29af9d45947dc044e33d69b9141d8d2dad37cc62
Author: Jerry Mouse <jerry@tutorialspoint.com>
Date: Wed Sep 11 10:16:25 2013 +0530

Added compiled binary
```

VCS is used to store the source code only and not executable binaries. So, Tom decides to remove this file from the repository. For further operation, he uses the __git rm__ command.

```bash
[tom@CentOS src]$ ls
Makefile string_operations string_operations.c

[tom@CentOS src]$ git rm string_operations
rm 'src/string_operations'

[tom@CentOS src]$ git commit -a -m "Removed executable binary"

[master 5776472] Removed executable binary
1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
delete mode 100755 src/string_operations
```

After commit, he pushes his changes to the repository.

```bash
[tom@CentOS src]$ git push origin master
```

The above command will produce the following result.

```bash
