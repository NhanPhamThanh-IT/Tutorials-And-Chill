# Git Tutorial
</div>

  __Git__ is a powerful version control system widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git has become an essential tool for developers worldwide. Understanding Git can significantly enhance your coding efficiency and collaboration.

This __Git Tutorial__ will walk you through the basics of Git, making it easy to learn and implement in your projects. you will learn __GitHub fundamentals__ and __advanced concepts__ like branches, pushing merge conflicts, and many useful Git Commands.

## Prerequisites
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Text Editor
- Basic Programming Concepts

## What is Git?
__Git__ is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects efficiently:

- Git was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development.
- Git is 2.45.1 is the Lastest Verions of GIT, released on May 2024.

## Why Use Git?
1. __Version control__: Git helps in tracking changes, allowing you to revert to previous states if something goes wrong.
2. __Collaboration__: It enables multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.
3. __Backup__: Your entire project history is saved in a Git repository, providing a backup of all versions.
4. __Branching and merging__: Git’s branching model allows you to experiment with new features or bug fixes independently from the main project.
5. __Open source projects__: Most open source projects use Git for version control. Learning Git allows you to contribute to these projects.
6. __Industry standard__: Git is widely used in the software industry, making it an essential skill for developers.

## Working with Git
1. __Initializing a repository__: When you initialize a folder with Git, it becomes a repository. Git logs all changes made to a hidden folder within that repository.
2. __Staging changes__: Git marks modified files as “staged.” Staging prepares changes for a snapshot you want to keep.
3. __Committing changes__: Once staged changes are satisfactory, commit them. Git maintains a complete record of each commit.

## What is Github?
GitHub, a hosting service for Git repositories, allows you to access and download projects from any computer. Here’s what you can do with GitHub:

1. __Store repositories__: GitHub hosts your repositories.
2. __Collaborate__: Work with other developers from any location.
3. __Version control__: Manage collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub.

## Internal Working of Git
Git uses a decentralized model where each developer has their own copy of the repository and works immediately on the project. Git manages the projects with repositories and can clone a project to operate locally on it.

With staging and committing it track changes and control. You can pull the latest code of the project to the local copy, and push local updates to the main projects.
