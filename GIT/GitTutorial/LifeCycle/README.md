In this chapter, we will discuss the life cycle of Git. In later chapters, we will cover the Git commands for each operation.

General workflow is as follows:

- You clone the Git repository as a working copy.
- You modify the working copy by adding/editing files.
- If necessary, you also update the working copy by taking other developer's changes.
- You review the changes before commit.
- You commit changes. If everything is fine, then you push the changes to the repository.
- After committing, if you realize something is wrong, then you correct the last commit and push the changes to the repository.

Shown below is the pictorial representation of the work-flow.
