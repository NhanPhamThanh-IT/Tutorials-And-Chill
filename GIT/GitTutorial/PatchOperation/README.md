# <div align="center">Patch Operation</div>

Patch is a text file, whose contents are similar to Git diff, but along with code, it also has metadata about commits; e.g., commit ID, date, commit message, etc. We can create a patch from commits and other people can apply them to their repository.

Jerry implements the strcat function for his project. Jerry can create a path of his code and send it to Tom. Then, he can apply the received patch to his code.

Jerry uses the Git __format-patch__ command to create a patch for the latest commit. If you want to create a patch for a specific commit, then use __COMMIT_ID__ with the format-patch command.

```bash
[jerry@CentOS project]$ pwd
/home/jerry/jerry_repo/project/src

[jerry@CentOS src]$ git status -s
M string_operations.c
?? string_operations

[jerry@CentOS src]$ git add string_operations.c

[jerry@CentOS src]$ git commit -m "Added my_strcat function"

[master b4c7f09] Added my_strcat function
1 files changed, 13 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

[jerry@CentOS src]$ git format-patch -1
0001-Added-my_strcat-function.patch
```

The above command creates __.patch__ files inside the current working directory. Tom can use this patch to modify his files. Git provides two commands to apply patches __git am__ and __git apply__, respectively. __Git apply__ modifies the local files without creating commit, while __git am__ modifies the file and creates commit as well.

To apply patch and create commit, use the following command:

```bash
[tom@CentOS src]$ pwd
/home/tom/top_repo/project/src

[tom@CentOS src]$ git diff

[tom@CentOS src]$ git status â€“s

[tom@CentOS src]$ git apply 0001-Added-my_strcat-function.patch

[tom@CentOS src]$ git status -s
M string_operations.c
?? 0001-Added-my_strcat-function.patch
```

The patch gets applied successfully, now we can view the modifications by using the __git diff__ command.

```bash
[tom@CentOS src]$ git diff
```

The above command will produce the following result:

```bash
diff --git a/src/string_operations.c b/src/string_operations.c
