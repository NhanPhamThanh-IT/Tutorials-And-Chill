Any value written within a pair of single quote or double quotes in R is treated as a string. Internally R stores every string within double quotes, even when you create them with single quote.

### Part 1 - Rules applied in String Construction

- The quotes at the beginning and end of a string should be both double quotes or both single quote. They can not be mixed.
- Double quotes can be inserted into a string starting and ending with single quote.
- Single quote can be inserted into a string starting and ending with double quotes.
- Double quotes can not be inserted into a string starting and ending with double quotes.
- Single quote can not be inserted into a string starting and ending with single quote.

### Part 2 - Examples of Valid Strings

Following examples clarify the rules about creating a string in R.

```r
a <- 'Start and end with single quote'
print(a)

b <- "Start and end with double quotes"
print(b)

c <- "single quote ' in between double quotes"
print(c)

d <- 'Double quotes " in between single quote'
print(d)
```

When the above code is run we get the following output:

```bash
[1] "Start and end with single quote"
[1] "Start and end with double quotes"
[1] "single quote ' in between double quote"
[1] "Double quote \" in between single quote"
```

### Part 3 - Examples of Invalid Strings

```r
e <- 'Mixed quotes" 
print(e)

f <- 'Single quote ' inside single quote'
print(f)

g <- "Double quotes " inside double quotes"
print(g)
```

When we run the script it fails giving below results.

```bash
Error: unexpected symbol in:
"print(e)
f <- 'Single"
Execution halted
```

## String Manipulation

### Function 1 - Concatenating Strings - paste() function

Many strings in R are combined using the __paste()__ function. It can take any number of arguments to be combined together.

#### Syntax

The basic syntax for paste function is:

```r
paste(..., sep = " ", collapse = NULL)
```

Following is the description of the parameters used:

- **...** represents any number of arguments to be combined.
- **sep** represents any separator between the arguments. It is optional.
- **collapse** is used to eliminate the space in between two strings. But not the space within two words of one string.

#### Example

```r
a <- "Hello"
b <- 'How'
c <- "are you? "

print(paste(a,b,c))

print(paste(a,b,c, sep = "-"))

print(paste(a,b,c, sep = "", collapse = ""))
```

When we execute the above code, it produces the following result:

```bash
[1] "Hello How are you? "
[1] "Hello-How-are you? "
[1] "HelloHoware you? "
```

### Function 2 - Formatting numbers & strings - format() function

Numbers and strings can be formatted to a specific style using __format()__ function.

#### Syntax

The basic syntax for format function is:

```r
format(x, digits, nsmall, scientific, width, justify = c("left", "right", "centre", "none"))
```

Following is the description of the parameters used:

- __x__ is the vector input.
- __digits__ is the total number of digits displayed.
- __nsmall__ is the minimum number of digits to the right of the decimal point.
- __scientific__ is set to TRUE to display scientific notation.
- __width__ indicates the minimum width to be displayed by padding blanks in the beginning.
- __justify__ is the display of the string to left, right or center.

#### Example

```r
# Total number of digits displayed. Last digit rounded off.
result <- format(23.123456789, digits = 9)
print(result)

# Display numbers in scientific notation.
result <- format(c(6, 13.14521), scientific = TRUE)
print(result)

# The minimum number of digits to the right of the decimal point.
result <- format(23.47, nsmall = 5)
print(result)

# Format treats everything as a string.
result <- format(6)
print(result)

# Numbers are padded with blank in the beginning for width.
result <- format(13.7, width = 6)
print(result)

# Left justify strings.
result <- format("Hello", width = 8, justify = "l")
print(result)

# Justfy string with center.
result <- format("Hello", width = 8, justify = "c")
print(result)
```

When we execute the above code, it produces the following result:

```bash
[1] "23.1234568"
[1] "6.000000e+00" "1.314521e+01"
[1] "23.47000"
[1] "6"
[1] "  13.7"
[1] "Hello   "
[1] " Hello  "
```

### Function 3 - Counting number of characters in a string - nchar() function

This function counts the number of characters including spaces in a string.

#### Syntax

The basic syntax for nchar() function is:

```r
nchar(x)
```

Following is the description of the parameters used:

- __x__ is the vector input.

#### Example

```r
result <- nchar("Count the number of characters")
print(result)
```

When we execute the above code, it produces the following result:

```bash
[1] 30
```

### Function 4 - Changing the case - toupper() & tolower() functions

These functions change the case of characters of a string.

#### Syntax

The basic syntax for toupper() & tolower() function is:

```r
toupper(x)
tolower(x)
```

Following is the description of the parameters used:

- __x__ is the vector input.

#### Example

```r
# Changing to Upper case.
result <- toupper("Changing To Upper")
print(result)

# Changing to lower case.
result <- tolower("Changing To Lower")
print(result)
```

When we execute the above code, it produces the following result:

```bash
[1] "CHANGING TO UPPER"
[1] "changing to lower"
```

### Function 5 - Extracting parts of a string - substring() function

This function extracts parts of a String.

#### Syntax

The basic syntax for substring() function is:

```r
substring(x,first,last)
```

Following is the description of the parameters used:

- __x__ is the character vector input.
- __first__ is the position of the first character to be extracted.
- __last__ is the position of the last character to be extracted.

#### Example

```r
# Extract characters from 5th to 7th position.
result <- substring("Extract", 5, 7)
print(result)
```

When we execute the above code, it produces the following result:

```bash
[1] "act"
```
