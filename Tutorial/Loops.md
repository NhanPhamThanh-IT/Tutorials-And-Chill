# <div align='center'>Loops</div>

There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially. The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.

### Loop statements

Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and the following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages:

R programming language provides the following kinds of loop to handle looping requirements. Click the following links to check their detail.

<table border="1" align="center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Sr.No.</th>
      <th align="center">Loop Type & Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">1</td>
      <td><strong>repeat loop</strong><br>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">2</td>
      <td><strong>while loop</strong><br>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">3</td>
      <td><strong>for loop</strong><br>Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Loop control statements

Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

R supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th align="center">Sr.No.</th>
      <th align="center">Control Statement & Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">1</td>
      <td><strong>break statement</strong><br>Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">2</td>
      <td><strong>Next statement</strong><br>The next statement simulates the behavior of R switch.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
