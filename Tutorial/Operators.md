An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. R language is rich in built-in operators and provides following types of operators.

### Part 1 - Types of Operators

We have the following types of operators in R programming:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Miscellaneous Operators

### Part 2 - Arithmetic Operators

Following table shows the arithmetic operators supported by R language. The operators act on each element of the vector.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+`      | Adds two vectors | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6) t <- c(8, 3, 4) print(v+t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] 10.0  8.5  10.0` |
| `-`      | Subtracts second vector from the first | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6) t <- c(8, 3, 4) print(v-t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] -6.0  2.5  2.0` |
| `*`      | Multiplies both vectors | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6) t <- c(8, 3, 4) print(v*t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] 16.0 16.5 24.0` |
| `/`      | Divides the first vector by the second | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6) t <- c(8, 3, 4) print(v/t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] 0.250000 1.833333 1.500000` |
| `%%`     | Gives the remainder of the first vector divided by the second | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6) t <- c(8, 3, 4) print(v%%t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] 2.0 2.5 2.0` |
| `%/%`    | Integer division (quotient) of the first vector by the second | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6) t <- c(8, 3, 4) print(v%/%t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] 0 1 1` |
| `^`      | Raises the first vector to the power of the second vector | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6) t <- c(8, 3, 4) print(v^t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] 256.000 166.375 1296.000` |

### Part 3 - Relational Operators

Following table shows the relational operators supported by R language. Each element of the first vector is compared with the corresponding element of the second vector. The result of comparison is a Boolean value.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `>`      | Checks if each element of the first vector is greater than the corresponding element of the second vector. | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6,9) t <- c(8,2.5,14,9) print(v > t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE` |
| `<`      | Checks if each element of the first vector is less than the corresponding element of the second vector. | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6,9) t <- c(8,2.5,14,9) print(v < t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE` |
| `==`     | Checks if each element of the first vector is equal to the corresponding element of the second vector. | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6,9) t <- c(8,2.5,14,9) print(v == t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE` |
| `<=`     | Checks if each element of the first vector is less than or equal to the corresponding element of the second vector. | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6,9) t <- c(8,2.5,14,9) print(v <= t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE` |
| `>=`     | Checks if each element of the first vector is greater than or equal to the corresponding element of the second vector. | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6,9) t <- c(8,2.5,14,9) print(v >= t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] FALSE TRUE FALSE TRUE` |
| `!=`     | Checks if each element of the first vector is unequal to the corresponding element of the second vector. | ```v <- c(2,5.5,6,9) t <- c(8,2.5,14,9) print(v != t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE` |

### Part 4 - Logical Operators

Following table shows the logical operators supported by R language. It is applicable only to vectors of type logical, numeric or complex. All numbers greater than 1 are considered as logical value TRUE.

Each element of the first vector is compared with the corresponding element of the second vector. The result of comparison is a Boolean value.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&`      | It is called Element-wise Logical AND operator. It combines each element of the first vector with the corresponding element of the second vector and gives a TRUE output if both elements are TRUE. | ```v <- c(3,1,TRUE,2+3i) t <- c(4,1,FALSE,2+3i) print(v & t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE` |
| `\|`      | It is called Element-wise Logical OR operator. It combines each element of the first vector with the corresponding element of the second vector and gives a TRUE output if one of the elements is TRUE. | ```v <- c(3,0,TRUE,2+2i) t <- c(4,0,FALSE,2+3i) print(v | t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE` |
| `!`      | It is called Logical NOT operator. Takes each element of the vector and gives the opposite logical value. | ```v <- c(3,0,TRUE,2+2i) print(!v)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE` |

The logical operator && and || considers only the first element of the vectors and give a vector of single element as output.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `&&`     | Called Logical AND operator. Takes the first element of both vectors and gives `TRUE` only if both are `TRUE`. | ```v <- c(3,0,TRUE,2+2i) t <- c(1,3,TRUE,2+3i) print(v && t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] TRUE` |
| `||`     | Called Logical OR operator. Takes the first element of both vectors and gives `TRUE` if one of them is `TRUE`. | ```v <- c(0,0,TRUE,2+2i) t <- c(0,3,TRUE,2+3i) print(v || t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] FALSE` |

### Part 5 - Assignment Operators

These operators are used to assign values to vectors.

| Operator   | Description         | Example |
|------------|---------------------|---------|
| `<-`, `=`, `<<-` | Called Left Assignment. These operators assign values to variables. The operator `<<-` assigns values in the global environment. | ``` v1 <- c(3,1,TRUE,2+3i) v2 <<- c(3,1,TRUE,2+3i) v3 = c(3,1,TRUE,2+3i) print(v1) print(v2) print(v3) ``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] 3+0i 1+0i 1+0i 2+3i` <br>`[1] 3+0i 1+0i 1+0i 2+3i` <br>`[1] 3+0i 1+0i 1+0i 2+3i` |
| `->`, `->>`   | Called Right Assignment. These operators assign values to variables from right to left. The operator `->>` assigns values in the global environment. | ``` c(3,1,TRUE,2+3i) -> v1 c(3,1,TRUE,2+3i) ->> v2 print(v1) print(v2) ``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] 3+0i 1+0i 1+0i 2+3i` <br>`[1] 3+0i 1+0i 1+0i 2+3i` |

### Part 6 - Miscellaneous Operators

These operators are used to for specific purpose and not general mathematical or logical computation.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `:`      | Colon operator. It creates a series of numbers in sequence for a vector. | ```v <- 2:8 print(v)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8` |
| `%in%`   | This operator is used to identify if an element belongs to a vector. | ```v1 <- 8 v2 <- 12 t <- 1:10 print(v1 %in% t) print(v2 %in% t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[1] TRUE` <br>`[1] FALSE` |
| `%*%`    | This operator is used to multiply a matrix with its transpose. | ```M <- matrix(c(2,6,5,1,10,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE) t <- M %*% t(M) print(t)``` <br>It produces the following result: <br>`[,1] [,2]` <br>`[1,] 65 82` <br>`[2,] 82 117` |
