Welcome to the **Python** section of the `Tutorials-And-Chill` repository!  
Here, you'll find simple, hands-on Python scripts and mini-projects to explore concepts, solve problems, and chill while learning.

## 📂 Structure

This folder contains:

- ✨ **Beginner-friendly examples**: For those just starting with Python.
- 🔧 **Practice scripts**: Useful for brushing up on syntax or logic.
- 📘 **Mini tutorials**: Covering specific topics like loops, functions, and file handling.

## 🛠 Requirements

Most scripts require only Python 3. No external dependencies unless specified in comments.

## 📚 How to Use

Clone the repo and run any script with:

```bash
python your_script.py

Some files are annotated with explanations or print debug messages to help you follow along.

## 💡 Purpose
This folder is a growing collection of small Python examples I use to learn, explain, or experiment. It's a space to stay sharp, stay curious, and stay chill 😎.
