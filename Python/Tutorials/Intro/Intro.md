# 🐍 Introduction to Python

## What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in **1991**.

It is widely used for:

- 🌐 Web development (server-side)
- 💻 Software development
- 🧮 Mathematics
- ⚙️ System scripting

## What Can Python Do?

Python is a versatile language and can be used for:

- ✅ Creating web applications on a server
- ✅ Automating workflows alongside other software
- ✅ Connecting to database systems and modifying files
- ✅ Handling big data and performing complex mathematical operations
- ✅ Rapid prototyping and developing production-ready software

## Why Python?

Python is a preferred choice for many developers because:

- 🖥️ It works on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- ✍️ It has a simple, English-like syntax
- 🧾 It allows writing programs with fewer lines of code
- ⚡ It runs on an interpreter system — making it great for quick prototyping
- 🔁 It supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles

## Good to Know

- The latest major version is **Python 3**, which is the focus of most current tutorials.
- **Python 2** is still in use, though only receives security updates.
- You can write Python using a simple **text editor**, but **IDEs** are recommended for managing larger projects like:
  - [Thonny](https://thonny.org/)
  - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
  - [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/)
  - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)

## Python Syntax Compared to Other Languages

Python was designed for **readability**, with influences from English and mathematics:

- **New lines** are used to complete a command (instead of semicolons or parentheses)
- **Indentation (whitespace)** defines scope (for loops, functions, classes), unlike other languages that use curly braces `{}`

Happy coding with Python! 🚀
