# Python Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)

## 1. What are Lambda Functions?

In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are often called "anonymous functions" because they don't have a formal name assigned through the standard `def` keyword used for creating regular functions.

Think of them as shorthand for creating simple functions on the fly. Lambda functions are restricted to a **single expression**. This means they can accept any number of arguments, but the function body can only contain one expression. The result of this expression is automatically returned when the lambda function is called. They cannot contain multiple statements, assignments, loops (`for`, `while`), or complex `if`/`else` blocks (though simple conditional logic using *conditional expressions* is allowed).

## 2. Syntax

The basic syntax for defining a lambda function is straightforward:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

*   `lambda`: The keyword that signals the definition of an anonymous function.
*   `arguments`: One or more argument names the function accepts, separated by commas (e.g., `x`, `x, y`, `*args`, `**kwargs`). These work just like arguments in regular functions.
*   `:`: A colon separates the arguments from the function's body (the expression).
*   `expression`: A single valid Python expression that performs the desired computation. The value this expression evaluates to is implicitly returned by the lambda function.

## 3. Lambda vs. Regular Functions (`def`)

Let's compare how you'd define a simple function using the standard `def` keyword versus using `lambda`.

**Regular Function (`def`):**

```python
# Define a function using def
def add_regular(x, y):
    """This function takes two arguments and returns their sum."""
    result = x + y
    return result

# Call the function
sum_result = add_regular(5, 3)
print(f"Using def: {sum_result}") # Output: Using def: 8
print(f"Function name: {add_regular.__name__}") # Output: Function name: add_regular
print(f"Docstring: {add_regular.__doc__}") # Output: Docstring: This function takes two arguments and returns their sum.
```

**Lambda Function:**

```python
# Define an equivalent lambda function
# Often assigned to a variable for demonstration, but not always necessary
add_lambda = lambda x, y: x + y

# Call the lambda function (via the variable)
sum_result = add_lambda(5, 3)
print(f"Using lambda: {sum_result}") # Output: Using lambda: 8

# Lambda functions are anonymous, assigning to a variable gives the *variable* a name
# but the function itself doesn't inherently have one like 'add_regular'
print(f"Variable holding lambda: {add_lambda}") # Output: Variable holding lambda: <function <lambda> at 0x...>
# Lambda functions cannot have docstrings
# print(add_lambda.__doc__) # Would result in None or an error depending on context
```

**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature         | `def` Function                     | `lambda` Function                     |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Naming**      | Has a formal name                  | Anonymous (no inherent name)          |
| **Body**        | Can contain multiple statements    | Limited to a single expression        |
| **Return**      | Uses explicit `return` statement | Implicitly returns expression result |
| **Docstrings**  | Can have docstrings (`"""..."""`) | Cannot have docstrings              |
| **Complexity**  | Suitable for complex logic       | Best for simple, short operations   |
| **Assignment**  | Name is part of definition       | Often used inline, can be assigned  |

While assigning a lambda to a variable (like `add_lambda`) is possible, Python style guides (like PEP 8) generally recommend using `def` for creating named functions because it's clearer and supports docstrings. The real power of `lambda` lies in its use as a quick, inline function, especially when passed as an argument to other functions.

## 4. Key Characteristics

*   **Anonymous:** They lack a formal name defined via `def`. When assigned to a variable, it's the variable that has a name, not the function object itself in the same way `def` defines it.
*   **Single Expression:** The body must be a single expression. Statements like `if condition: ... else: ...` (multi-line blocks), `for`, `while`, `try`/`except`, `print()`, `return`, or variable assignments (`=`) are **not allowed** inside the lambda body.
*   **Conditional Expressions Allowed:** You *can* use the ternary conditional operator (`value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`) within the expression.
*   **Inline Usage:** Often defined directly where needed, most commonly as arguments to higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as input).
*   **Implicit Return:** The result of evaluating the `expression` is automatically returned. You do not (and cannot) use the `return` keyword.
*   **Can Access Outer Scope Variables (Closures):** Lambda functions can "capture" and use variables from the scope in which they were defined.

## 5. Common Use Cases: Higher-Order Functions

Lambda functions shine when used with functions that accept another function as an argument. These are known as higher-order functions. Common examples in Python include `sorted()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `functools.reduce()`.

**a) `sorted()`:** Sorting iterables based on a custom key.

The `key` argument of `sorted()` (and the `list.sort()` method) expects a function that takes one element from the iterable and returns the value (the "key") to use for comparison during sorting. Lambdas are perfect for providing simple key-extraction logic.

```python
# Example 1: Sorting points based on the second element (y-coordinate)
points = [(1, 5), (3, 2), (5, 8), (2, 1)]
points_sorted_by_y = sorted(points, key=lambda point: point[1])
print(f"Original points: {points}")
print(f"Sorted by y-coordinate: {points_sorted_by_y}")
# Output: Sorted by y-coordinate: [(2, 1), (3, 2), (1, 5), (5, 8)]

# Example 2: Sorting strings by length
words = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "orange", "fig"]
words_sorted_by_length = sorted(words, key=lambda word: len(word))
print(f"\nOriginal words: {words}")
print(f"Sorted by length: {words_sorted_by_length}")
# Output: Sorted by length: ['kiwi', 'fig', 'apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# Example 3: Sorting a list of dictionaries by age
people = [
        {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30},
        {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25},
        {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35}
]
people_sorted_by_age = sorted(people, key=lambda person: person['age'])
print(f"\nOriginal people: {people}")
print(f"Sorted by age: {people_sorted_by_age}")
# Output: Sorted by age: [{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35}]
```

**b) `map()`:** Applying a function to every item in an iterable.

`map(function, iterable, ...)` applies the `function` to each item from the `iterable`(s) and returns a *map object* (an iterator) containing the results. Lambdas provide a concise way to define the function to be applied.

```python
# Example 1: Square each number
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers_iterator = map(lambda x: x * x, numbers)
squared_numbers = list(squared_numbers_iterator) # Convert iterator to list to see results
print(f"\nOriginal numbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Squared numbers: {squared_numbers}")
# Output: Squared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Example 2: Convert numbers to strings
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
number_strings = list(map(lambda x: str(x) + ' units', numbers))
print(f"\nOriginal numbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Number strings: {number_strings}")
# Output: Number strings: ['10 units', '20 units', '30 units']

# Example 3: Map with multiple iterables (lambda takes multiple arguments)
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
sums = list(map(lambda x, y: x + y, list1, list2))
print(f"\nList 1: {list1}")
print(f"List 2: {list2}")
print(f"Sums: {sums}")
# Output: Sums: [5, 7, 9]
```

**c) `filter()`:** Filtering elements from an iterable based on a condition.

`filter(function, iterable)` constructs an iterator (a *filter object*) from elements of the `iterable` for which the `function` returns `True`. Lambdas are ideal for defining simple filtering conditions.

```python
# Example 1: Get only the even numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers_iterator = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
even_numbers = list(even_numbers_iterator) # Convert iterator to list
print(f"\nOriginal numbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Even numbers: {even_numbers}")
# Output: Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Example 2: Filter words longer than 5 characters
words = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi", "orange", "fig", "strawberry"]
long_words = list(filter(lambda word: len(word) > 5, words))
print(f"\nOriginal words: {words}")
print(f"Long words: {long_words}")
# Output: Long words: ['banana', 'orange', 'strawberry']

# Example 3: Filter out None values
mixed_list = [1, None, 2, 0, None, 3, False]
# Note: In boolean context, None, 0, and False are considered False.
# The lambda x: x is equivalent to lambda x: bool(x) for filtering truthy values
non_none_values = list(filter(lambda x: x is not None, mixed_list))
print(f"\nOriginal mixed list: {mixed_list}")
print(f"Non-None values: {non_none_values}")
# Output: Non-None values: [1, 2, 0, 3, False]
```

**d) `functools.reduce()`:** Accumulating values in an iterable.

`reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])` applies the `function` cumulatively to the items of the `iterable`, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value. The `function` must take two arguments. `reduce` is part of the `functools` module, so you need to import it.

```python
import functools

# Example 1: Calculate the sum of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates
# (((1+2)+3)+4)+5
total = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)
print(f"\nNumbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Sum using reduce: {total}") # Output: Sum using reduce: 15

# Example 2: Find the maximum value
numbers = [3, 5, 2, 8, 4]
maximum = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x if x > y else y, numbers)
print(f"\nNumbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Maximum using reduce: {maximum}") # Output: Maximum using reduce: 8

# Example 3: Calculate sum with an initializer (starting value)
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
total_with_initializer = functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers, 100) # Starts sum at 100
print(f"\nNumbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Sum with initializer 100: {total_with_initializer}") # Output: Sum with initializer 100: 106
```
*Note:* While `reduce` is powerful, often simple loops or functions like `sum()` are more readable for common reduction tasks like summing numbers.

## 6. Using Conditional Expressions in Lambdas

As mentioned, you can't use full `if/else` statements, but you can use the inline conditional (ternary) expression: `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`.

```python
# Example: Return 'even' or 'odd' based on the number
check_even_odd = lambda x: "even" if x % 2 == 0 else "odd"

print(f"\nCheck 4: {check_even_odd(4)}")   # Output: Check 4: even
print(f"Check 7: {check_even_odd(7)}")   # Output: Check 7: odd

# Example: Clamp a value within a range (e.g., 0 to 100)
clamp = lambda value, min_val=0, max_val=100: min_val if value < min_val else max_val if value > max_val else value

print(f"Clamp -5: {clamp(-5)}")    # Output: Clamp -5: 0
print(f"Clamp 50: {clamp(50)}")    # Output: Clamp 50: 50
print(f"Clamp 120: {clamp(120)}")  # Output: Clamp 120: 100
```

## 7. Lambdas and Closures

Lambda functions can access variables from the containing scope (the scope where they are defined). This is known as a closure.

```python
def make_multiplier(n):
    """Returns a function that multiplies its argument by n."""
    # n is captured from the outer scope by the lambda
    return lambda x: x * n

# Create a function that doubles
doubler = make_multiplier(2)
# Create a function that triples
tripler = make_multiplier(3)

print(f"\nDoubler(5): {doubler(5)}")   # Output: Doubler(5): 10 (n=2 was captured)
print(f"Tripler(5): {tripler(5)}")   # Output: Tripler(5): 15 (n=3 was captured)
print(f"Doubler(10): {doubler(10)}") # Output: Doubler(10): 20
```
Here, the lambda function defined inside `make_multiplier` "remembers" the value of `n` that existed when it was created.

## 8. Limitations

*   **Single Expression Only:** This is the most significant limitation. You cannot perform multiple actions, assignments, loops, or use complex control flow statements within a lambda.
*   **Readability:** For logic that isn't immediately obvious or requires multiple steps, a standard `def` function with a clear name and potentially comments/docstrings is much more readable and maintainable. Overly complex lambdas can become difficult to understand.
*   **No Statements:** You cannot include statements like `print()`, `import`, `raise`, `try`/`except`, `pass`, `del`, or assignments (`=`) inside a lambda.
*   **No Docstrings:** Lambda functions cannot have formal docstrings to explain their purpose.

## 9. Alternatives: List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions

For many common uses of `map` and `filter` with lambdas, list comprehensions (for creating lists) and generator expressions (for creating iterators) are often considered more "Pythonic" and readable.

**Map Example Revisited:**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using map and lambda
squared_map = list(map(lambda x: x * x, numbers))

# Using list comprehension (often preferred)
squared_lc = [x * x for x in numbers]

print(f"\nSquared with map/lambda: {squared_map}")
print(f"Squared with list comprehension: {squared_lc}")
# Output:
# Squared with map/lambda: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
# Squared with list comprehension: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

**Filter Example Revisited:**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Using filter and lambda
even_filter = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

# Using list comprehension
even_lc = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

# Using generator expression (if you only need to iterate once)
even_gen = (x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0)

print(f"\nEven with filter/lambda: {even_filter}")
print(f"Even with list comprehension: {even_lc}")
print(f"Even with generator expression (converted to list): {list(even_gen)}")
# Output:
# Even with filter/lambda: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# Even with list comprehension: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# Even with generator expression (converted to list): [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

List comprehensions and generator expressions directly integrate the transformation/filtering logic with the loop structure, which many Python developers find clearer for these specific tasks.

## 10. When to Use Lambda Functions

Despite the alternatives, lambda functions remain valuable:

*   **Key Functions:** As the `key` argument for `sorted()`, `min()`, `max()`, etc., when the key extraction logic is simple.
*   **Short, Simple Callbacks:** In GUI programming (like Tkinter, PyQt) or other frameworks where you need to pass a small function to handle an event.
*   **Higher-Order Functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`):** When the operation is very simple and using a lambda is more concise than defining a separate one-line `def` function nearby.
*   **Functional Programming Style:** When adopting a more functional programming approach, lambdas are a natural fit.

**General Guideline:** If the logic is simple enough for a single expression and you don't need to reuse it elsewhere by name, a lambda can be a good choice. If the logic becomes complex, requires multiple steps, or needs documentation, use a standard `def` function.
