# If-Else in Python: A Detailed Guide for Beginners

Conditional statements are the backbone of decision-making in programming. Python's `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else` statements allow your program to execute specific blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are met.

## The `if` Statement

The simplest form of conditional execution is the `if` statement. It executes a block of code *only* if a specified condition evaluates to `True`.

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition:
    # This block runs if 'condition' is True
    # Indentation is crucial here!
    statement1
    statement2
    # ...
# Code here runs regardless of the condition, as it's outside the if block
```

**Flow of Execution:**
1. The `condition` is evaluated.
2. If the `condition` is `True`, the indented block of code under the `if` statement is executed.
3. If the `condition` is `False`, the indented block is skipped, and execution continues with the code following the `if` block.

**Example:**
```python
temperature = 30
if temperature > 25:
    print("It's a warm day!")
print("This message always prints.") # This line is outside the if block
```

## The `if-else` Statement

Often, you want to execute one block of code if a condition is `True` and a *different* block if the condition is `False`. This is where `else` comes in.

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition:
    # This block runs if 'condition' is True
    statement1_if_true
else:
    # This block runs if 'condition' is False
    statement1_if_false
```

**Flow of Execution:**
1. The `condition` is evaluated.
2. If `True`, the `if` block is executed, and the `else` block is skipped.
3. If `False`, the `if` block is skipped, and the `else` block is executed.
4. Execution then continues with the code following the `if-else` structure.

**Example:**
```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```

## The `if-elif-else` Statement (Chain of Conditions)

Sometimes you need to check multiple conditions in sequence. The `elif` (else if) statement allows you to check additional conditions if the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions were `False`. The `else` block at the end is optional and runs if *none* of the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions were `True`.

**Syntax:**
```python
if condition1:
    # Runs if condition1 is True
    statements_block1
elif condition2:
    # Runs if condition1 is False AND condition2 is True
    statements_block2
elif condition3:
    # Runs if condition1 and condition2 are False AND condition3 is True
    statements_block3
# ... more elif statements can be added
else:
    # Runs if ALL preceding conditions (if, elif) are False
    statements_block_else
```

**Flow of Execution:**
1. `condition1` is checked. If `True`, `statements_block1` runs, and the rest of the chain (`elif`, `else`) is skipped.
2. If `condition1` is `False`, `condition2` is checked. If `True`, `statements_block2` runs, and the rest is skipped.
3. This continues down the `elif` chain.
4. If *all* `if` and `elif` conditions are `False`, the `else` block (`statements_block_else`) is executed (if present).
5. Execution continues after the entire `if-elif-else` structure.

**Example:**
```python
marks = 85
if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 50:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

## Nested `if` Statements

You can place `if`, `if-else`, or `if-elif-else` statements inside the code blocks of other `if`, `elif`, or `else` statements. This is called nesting.

**Example:**
```python
number = 10
if number > 0:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print("The number is positive and even.")
    else:
        print("The number is positive and odd.")
else:
    print("The number is not positive.")
```

**Caution:** While powerful, excessive nesting can make code hard to read and debug. Try to keep nesting levels minimal.

## Conditions and Boolean Logic

Conditions in `if` statements evaluate to a Boolean value: `True` or `False`.

*   **Comparison Operators:** Used to compare values (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
*   **Logical Operators:** Used to combine multiple Boolean expressions:
    *   `and`: `True` only if *both* sides are `True`. (`A and B`)
    *   `or`: `True` if *at least one* side is `True`. (`A or B`)
    *   `not`: Inverts the Boolean value. (`not A`)

**Example (Logical Operators):**
```python
age = 20
has_id = True
if age >= 18 and has_id:
    print("You can enter the club.")
else:
    print("You cannot enter the club.")
```

**Order of Operations:** `not` is evaluated first, then `and`, then `or`. Use parentheses `()` to control the order if needed.

## Truthy and Falsy Values

In Python, values other than `True` and `False` can also be evaluated in a Boolean context (like an `if` condition).

*   **Falsy Values:** These evaluate to `False` in a Boolean context.
    *   `False`
    *   `None`
    *   Zero of any numeric type (`0`, `0.0`, `0j`)
    *   Empty sequences (`''`, `[]`, `()`, `{}`)
    *   Empty mappings (`{}`)
    *   Objects for which `obj.__bool__()` returns `False` or `obj.__len__()` returns `0`.
*   **Truthy Values:** All other values evaluate to `True`. This includes non-empty strings, non-zero numbers, lists/tuples/dicts with items, etc.

**Example:**
```python
my_list = []
if my_list: # This condition is False because the list is empty
    print("List has items.")
else:
    print("List is empty.")

name = "Alice"
if name: # This condition is True because the string is not empty
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## The Ternary Conditional Operator (Shorthand `if-else`)

Python provides a concise way to write simple `if-else` statements in a single line, often used for assignments.

**Syntax:**
```python
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

**Example:**
```python
age = 20
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status) # Output: Adult

can_vote = True if age >= 18 else False
print(can_vote) # Output: True
```
This is equivalent to:
```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    status = "Adult"
else:
    status = "Minor"
print(status)
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1.  **Indentation Errors**: Python relies *strictly* on indentation. Mixing tabs and spaces or inconsistent indentation will cause errors (`IndentationError`). Use 4 spaces per indentation level (standard practice).
2.  **Assignment (`=`) vs. Comparison (`==`)**: Using a single equals sign (`=`) assigns a value, while double equals (`==`) checks for equality. Using `=` in an `if` condition is usually a mistake (though technically possible in some contexts with the 'walrus operator' `:=` in Python 3.8+, it's different from comparison).
3.  **Missing Colons (`:`)**: Every `if`, `elif`, and `else` line must end with a colon. Forgetting it leads to a `SyntaxError`.
4.  **Case Sensitivity**: Python is case-sensitive. `True` is not the same as `true`. Variable names `age` and `Age` are different.

## Practice Problems
1. Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a program to determine if a year is a leap year (remember the rules!).
3. Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using `if-elif-else`.
4. Write a program that takes a username as input. If the username is not empty, print "Welcome, [username]!". If it's empty, print "Username cannot be empty." (Use truthy/falsy evaluation).
5. Use the ternary operator to assign "Even" or "Odd" to a variable based on whether a number is even or odd.
