# Polymorphism in Python

## What is Polymorphism?

The word "polymorphism" comes from Greek words: "poly" meaning "many" and "morph" meaning "form" or "shape". So, polymorphism literally means "many forms".

In programming, polymorphism refers to the ability of an object, function, or method to take on many forms or behave differently depending on the context or the type of data it is operating on. It allows you to define a common interface for different underlying forms (data types or classes).

Think of a real-world example: the verb "open". You can "open" a door, "open" a book, "open" a file on your computer, or "open" a bank account. The action "open" is the same in name, but the specific steps involved are different depending on *what* you are opening. Polymorphism in programming works similarly.

## Polymorphism in Python

Python is a dynamically typed language, which makes polymorphism very natural and easy to implement. Unlike statically typed languages (like Java or C++), you don't always need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. Python figures out the type at runtime. This flexibility allows functions and methods to operate on objects of different types as long as they support the required operations or methods (this is often called **Duck Typing**).

**Duck Typing:** The idea is: "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck." In Python, we don't care so much about the *exact* class of an object, but rather if it has the methods or attributes we need to perform an operation.

Let's explore different ways polymorphism manifests in Python:

### 1. Function Polymorphism (Built-in Examples)

Many built-in Python functions exhibit polymorphism.

*   **`len()` function:** You can use `len()` on various types like strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, etc. It returns the length or number of items, but *how* it calculates that depends on the object's type.

    ```python
    print(len("Hello"))      # Output: 5 (length of string)
    print(len([1, 2, 3]))    # Output: 3 (number of items in list)
    print(len({"a": 1, "b": 2})) # Output: 2 (number of key-value pairs in dict)
    ```

*   **`+` operator:** The `+` operator performs addition for numbers but concatenation for strings or lists.

    ```python
    print(5 + 3)         # Output: 8 (Numeric addition)
    print("Hello" + " World") # Output: Hello World (String concatenation)
    print([1, 2] + [3, 4]) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (List concatenation)
    ```

### 2. Polymorphism with Class Methods (Duck Typing)

This is where we see polymorphism in object-oriented programming. We can create different classes that have methods with the same name. Then, we can call that method on objects of these different classes, and the correct implementation will be executed based on the object's type.

```python
class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

class Duck:
    def speak(self):
        return "Quack!"

# A function that can work with any object that has a 'speak' method
def make_animal_speak(animal):
    # We don't care if animal is a Dog, Cat, or Duck.
    # We only care that it has a 'speak()' method.
    print(animal.speak())

# Create instances of different classes
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
duck = Duck()

# Call the same function with different object types
print("Dog says:")
make_animal_speak(dog)   # Output: Woof!

print("\nCat says:")
make_animal_speak(cat)   # Output: Meow!

print("\nDuck says:")
make_animal_speak(duck)  # Output: Quack!

# You can even put them in a list and iterate
animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Duck()]
print("\nAnimals in a list:")
for animal in animals:
    make_animal_speak(animal)
```

In this example, the `make_animal_speak` function doesn't need to know the specific type of `animal`. It just calls the `speak()` method. Python figures out at runtime which class's `speak()` method to execute based on the object passed to the function. This is polymorphism in action via duck typing.

### 3. Polymorphism with Inheritance (Method Overriding)

Polymorphism is often used with inheritance. A base class can define a method, and derived classes (subclasses) can provide their own specific implementations of that method. This is called **method overriding**.

```python
import math

class Shape:
    """Base class for geometric shapes."""
    def area(self):
        # Base implementation (or could raise an error)
        print("Calculating area in the base Shape class (not defined)")
        return 0

class Rectangle(Shape):
    """Represents a rectangle, inherits from Shape."""
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    # Override the area method
    def area(self):
        print(f"Calculating area of a Rectangle ({self.width}x{self.height})")
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    """Represents a circle, inherits from Shape."""
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    # Override the area method
    def area(self):
        print(f"Calculating area of a Circle (radius {self.radius})")
        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2

# Function that works with any Shape object (or subclass)
def print_area(shape_object):
    # It expects an object with an 'area()' method
    calculated_area = shape_object.area()
    print(f"The calculated area is: {calculated_area:.2f}\n")

# Create instances of the subclasses
rect = Rectangle(5, 4)
circ = Circle(3)
generic_shape = Shape() # Instance of the base class

# Call the same function with different objects
print_area(rect)
# Output:
# Calculating area of a Rectangle (5x4)
# The calculated area is: 20.00

print_area(circ)
# Output:
# Calculating area of a Circle (radius 3)
# The calculated area is: 28.27

print_area(generic_shape)
# Output:
# Calculating area in the base Shape class (not defined)
# The calculated area is: 0.00
```

Here, `Rectangle` and `Circle` both inherit from `Shape`. They both provide their own specific version of the `area()` method. The `print_area` function can accept any object that is a `Shape` (or a subclass like `Rectangle` or `Circle`). When `shape_object.area()` is called inside `print_area`, Python executes the `area` method specific to the actual object's class (`Rectangle.area` or `Circle.area`).

## Benefits of Polymorphism

1.  **Flexibility and Extensibility:** You can add new classes (like adding a `Triangle` class inheriting from `Shape`) that conform to the expected interface (having an `area` method) without changing the functions that use these objects (like `print_area`).
2.  **Simpler Code:** Functions can be written more generically, operating on a wider range of objects without needing complex `if-elif-else` statements to check for specific types.
3.  **Readability:** Code becomes easier to understand because you are working with a common interface (`speak()`, `area()`).

## Key Takeaways for Beginners

*   Polymorphism means "many forms". It allows the same operation (like a function call or method call) to behave differently depending on the object it's applied to.
*   Python supports polymorphism naturally due to its dynamic typing (Duck Typing).
*   You see polymorphism with built-in functions (`len()`), operators (`+`), and commonly in object-oriented programming with class methods (either through duck typing or inheritance/method overriding).
*   It makes code more flexible, extensible, and often simpler to write and read.

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that helps in building robust and adaptable software.
