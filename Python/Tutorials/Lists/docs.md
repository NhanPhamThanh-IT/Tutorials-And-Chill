# Lists in Python

## Introduction

In Python, a **list** is one of the most commonly used built-in data structures. It's a versatile, ordered, and mutable (changeable) sequence of items. Lists can hold items of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists.

## Creating Lists

You create a list by placing items inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.

```python
# An empty list
empty_list = []
print(empty_list)

# A list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)

# A list of strings
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)

# A list with mixed data types
mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
print(mixed_list)

# A list containing another list (nested list)
nested_list = [1, 2, ["a", "b", "c"], 3]
print(nested_list)
```

## Accessing List Elements

You can access individual items in a list using their **index**. Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first item is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Access the first element
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

# Access the third element
print(fruits[2])  # Output: cherry
```

You can also use **negative indexing** to access elements from the end of the list. Index `-1` refers to the last item, `-2` to the second-to-last, and so on.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Access the last element
print(fruits[-1]) # Output: cherry

# Access the second-to-last element
print(fruits[-2]) # Output: banana
```

Accessing an index that doesn't exist will result in an `IndexError`.

## Slicing Lists

Slicing allows you to get a sub-list (a portion) of the original list. The syntax is `list[start:stop:step]`.

*   `start`: The index where the slice begins (inclusive). Defaults to 0.
*   `stop`: The index where the slice ends (exclusive). Defaults to the end of the list.
*   `step`: The amount to increment by. Defaults to 1.

```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Get elements from index 2 up to (but not including) index 5
print(numbers[2:5])   # Output: [2, 3, 4]

# Get elements from the beginning up to index 3
print(numbers[:3])    # Output: [0, 1, 2]

# Get elements from index 5 to the end
print(numbers[5:])    # Output: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Get every second element
print(numbers[::2])   # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# Get a copy of the entire list
print(numbers[:])     # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Reverse the list using slicing
print(numbers[::-1])  # Output: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```

## Modifying Lists

Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after they are created.

### Changing Elements

You can change an item at a specific index by assigning a new value to it.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
print(fruits) # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']
```

### Adding Elements

*   `append(item)`: Adds an item to the *end* of the list.
*   `insert(index, item)`: Inserts an item at a specific *index*.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]

# Add 'cherry' to the end
fruits.append("cherry")
print(fruits) # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Insert 'orange' at index 1
fruits.insert(1, "orange")
print(fruits) # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### Removing Elements

*   `remove(item)`: Removes the *first occurrence* of a specific item. Raises a `ValueError` if the item is not found.
*   `pop(index)`: Removes and returns the item at a specific *index*. If no index is specified, it removes and returns the *last* item.
*   `del list[index]`: Removes the item at a specific index. Can also remove slices.
*   `clear()`: Removes all items from the list.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry", "banana"]

# Remove the first 'banana'
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits) # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry', 'banana']

# Remove and return the item at index 1 ('orange')
removed_fruit = fruits.pop(1)
print(fruits)        # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'banana']
print(removed_fruit) # Output: orange

# Remove the last item
last_fruit = fruits.pop()
print(fruits)      # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']
print(last_fruit)  # Output: banana

# Remove the item at index 0 using del
del fruits[0]
print(fruits) # Output: ['cherry']

# Clear the list
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.clear()
print(numbers) # Output: []

# Delete an entire list variable (removes the variable itself)
# del numbers
# print(numbers) # This would cause a NameError
```

## Common List Methods and Functions

*   `len(list)`: Returns the number of items in the list.
*   `sort()`: Sorts the list in ascending order (in-place). Items must be comparable.
*   `sort(reverse=True)`: Sorts the list in descending order.
*   `reverse()`: Reverses the order of elements in the list (in-place).
*   `count(item)`: Returns the number of times an item appears in the list.
*   `index(item)`: Returns the index of the *first occurrence* of an item. Raises `ValueError` if not found.
*   `copy()`: Returns a shallow copy of the list.

```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
fruits = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]

# Length
print(len(numbers)) # Output: 7

# Count occurrences of 1
print(numbers.count(1)) # Output: 2

# Find index of first 4
print(numbers.index(4)) # Output: 2

# Sort numbers (in-place)
numbers.sort()
print(numbers) # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]

# Sort fruits (in-place)
fruits.sort()
print(fruits) # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Reverse numbers (in-place)
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers) # Output: [9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]

# Create a copy
numbers_copy = numbers.copy()
numbers_copy.append(100)
print(numbers)      # Output: [9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1] (original unchanged)
print(numbers_copy) # Output: [9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 100]
```

## List Operations

### Concatenation (`+`)

You can combine two lists using the `+` operator.

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined_list = list1 + list2
print(combined_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Repetition (`*`)

You can repeat the elements of a list using the `*` operator.

```python
list1 = ["a", "b"]
repeated_list = list1 * 3
print(repeated_list) # Output: ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b']
```

## List Comprehensions (A Glimpse)

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses.

```python
# Create a list of squares from 0 to 9
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares) # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# Create a list of even numbers from 0 to 9
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)   # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

List comprehensions are often more readable and efficient than using traditional loops to build lists.

## Summary

Lists are fundamental to Python programming. They are:

*   **Ordered**: Items maintain their position.
*   **Mutable**: You can change, add, or remove items after creation.
*   **Heterogeneous**: Can contain items of different data types.
*   **Dynamic**: They can grow or shrink in size.

Understanding how to create, access, modify, and manipulate lists is crucial for any Python developer.
